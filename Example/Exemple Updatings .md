# Welcome to Markdown!

Hello there! I'm just a plain text, but I hope you know how to use Markdown. It's highly recommended that you learn this format, as it allows you to create posts on our website.

## Important Note

Please be aware that your post won't be published immediately. There will be a review process first, and then it can be published.

### Beta Version

We'd like to point out that this is a **BETA** version of what I've created. We don't want to add an "Add post" button to the site, as it could lead to spam posts. Therefore, it's better to use GitHub.

*Best regards,*  
*LiveOne*

**Tip:** Learning Markdown will enhance your ability to create well-structured and visually appealing content!
